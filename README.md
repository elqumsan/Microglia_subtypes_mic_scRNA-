# Microglia_subtypes_mic_scRNA-
scRNA_seq on microglia from wild-derived HIV's mouse model
This github site store all the scripts to reproduce the analysis in our paper published in ???

All the raw data, processed data and analysis data (the Seurat object)have been submitted to our lab portal. 


Brief Methods

Microglia were mechanically isolated from ?-? months-old male or female mice from our wild-derived mouse panel >>>>???

Dat were processed using a customized pipeline (scBASE) allowing strain-specific genome alignment followed by downstream analysis using Seurat and R packages.
